# TX Custom Boot
This is a script to repack any Fusee-Gelee/Shofel2 payloads to a boot.dat so you can boot them directly with an SX Pro Dognle.
All of this is written by [CTCaer](https://github.com/CTCaer) and originated [here](https://twitter.com/CTCaer/status/1017048606971453441), I'm merely re-upping this in case the original is deleted, and so others/myself can find it.

## Pre-Reqs
Python3

## Usage
`python tx_custom_boot.py payload.bin`
